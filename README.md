## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ian Tozer!

I seek to deliver value through full-stack development, writing & smart contract auditing.

Currently working with Golang, Solidity, JavaScript and Rust across EVM and SOL ecosystems.

I've found [Elon Musk's five step process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhuaVsOAMFc) to be extremely effective in delivering high-value software in considerably shorter time-frames, and it's my method of working:

1) Evaluate, Simplify, and Refine Requirements
2) Delete Parts or Process Parts
3) Simplify or Optimize
4) Iterate faster
5) Automate
